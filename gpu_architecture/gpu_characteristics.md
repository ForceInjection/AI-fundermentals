# GPU Characteristics（GPU 特性）

**原文：[Cornell University -> Cornell Virtual Workshop -> Understanding GPU Architecture -> GPU Characteristics](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/gpu-architecture/gpu-characteristics/index)**

The hardware design for graphics processing units (GPUs) is optimized for highly parallel processing. As a result, application programs for GPUs rely on programming models like NVIDIA CUDA that can differ substantially from traditional serial programming models based on CPUs. Still, one may ask: is the world of GPUs really so different from the world of CPUs? If one looks more closely, one discovers that many aspects of a GPU's architecture resemble those of modern CPUs, and the differences are at least partly a matter of terminology.

图形处理单元（GPU）的硬件设计优化了高度并行处理。因此，GPU的应用程序依赖于像NVIDIA CUDA这样的编程模型，与传统的基于CPU的串行编程模型有很大不同。尽管如此，人们可能会问：GPU的世界真的与CPU的世界如此不同吗？如果仔细研究，就会发现GPU的许多架构方面与现代CPU相似，差异至少部分是术语上的问题。

# Design: GPU vs. CPU（设计：GPU 与 CPU）

GPUs were originally designed to render graphics. They work very well for shading, texturing, and rendering the thousands of independent polygons that comprise a 3D object. CPUs, on the other hand, are meant to control the logical flow of any general-purpose program, where lots of number crunching may (or may not) be involved. Due to these very different roles, GPUs are characterized by many more processing units and higher aggregate memory bandwidth, while CPUs feature more sophisticated instruction processing and faster clock speed.

GPU最初是为渲染图形而设计的。它们非常适合着色、纹理化和渲染构成3D对象的数千个独立多边形。而CPU则是设计用来控制任何通用程序的逻辑流程，其中可能涉及（也可能不涉及）大量的数字计算。由于这些非常不同的作用，GPU的特点是拥有更多的处理单元和更高的总内存带宽，而CPU则具有更复杂的指令处理和更快的时钟速度。

The figure below illustrates the main differences in hardware architecture between CPUs and GPUs. The transistor counts associated with various functions are represented abstractly by the relative sizes of the different shaded areas. In the figure, green corresponds to computation; gold is instruction processing; purple is L1 cache; blue is higher-level cache, and orange is memory (DRAM, which should really be thousands of times larger than the caches).

下面的图表展示了CPU和GPU硬件架构之间的主要区别。与各种功能相关的晶体管数量通过不同阴影区域的相对大小抽象表示。在图表中，绿色代表计算；金色是指令处理；紫色是L1缓存；蓝色是更高级别的缓存，橙色是内存（DRAM，实际上应该比缓存大几千倍）。

Comparing the relative capabilities of the basic elements of CPU and GPU architectures.

This diagram, which is taken from the [CUDA C++ Programming Guide (v.11.2)](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/11.2.0/pdf/CUDA_C_Programming_Guide.pdf), does not depict the actual hardware design of any particular CPU or GPU. However, based on the size, color, and number of the various blocks, the figure does suggest that:

这张图表取自CUDA C++编程指南（第11.2版），并不描绘任何特定CPU或GPU的实际硬件设计。然而，根据不同区域的大小、颜色和数量，该图表确实表明：

1.  CPUs can handle more complex workflows compared to GPUs.
2.  CPUs don't have as many arithmetic logic units or floating point units as GPUs (the small green boxes above, roughly speaking), but the ALUs and FPUs in a CPU core are individually more capable.
3.  CPUs have more cache memory than GPUs.

1.  CPU 可以处理比 GPU 更复杂的工作流程。
2.  CPU 没有 GPU 那么多的算术逻辑单元或浮点单元（上面的小绿盒，大致来说），但 CPU 核心中的 ALU 和 FPU 每个都更有能力。
3.  CPU 拥有比 GPU 更多的缓存内存。

A final point is that GPUs are really designed for workloads that can be parallelized to a significant degree. This is indicated in the diagram by having just one gold control box for every row of the little green computational boxes.

最后一点是，GPU确实设计用于能够显著并行化的工作负载。这在图表中通过每一行小绿计算盒有一个金色控制盒来表示。

# Performance: GPU vs. CPU（性能：GPU 与 CPU）

GPUs and CPUs are intended for fundamentally different types of workloads. CPUs are typically designed for multitasking and fast serial processing, while GPUs are designed to produce high computational throughput using their massively parallel architectures.

GPU和CPU旨在处理根本不同类型的工作负载。CPU通常设计用于多任务处理和快速串行处理，而GPU旨在使用其大规模并行架构产生高计算吞吐量。

The chart below, which is adapted from the [CUDA C Programming Guide (v.9.1)](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/9.1/pdf/CUDA_C_Programming_Guide.pdf), shows the raw computational speed of different CPUs and GPUs. The purpose of the figure is to show the computational potential of GPUs, as measured in billions of floating-point operations per second (Gflop/s). One can ask: given a device that delivers such impressive floating-point performance, is it possible to use it for something besides graphics?

下面的图表，改编自 CUDA C 编程指南（第9.1版），展示了不同 CPU 和 GPU 的原始计算速度。该图表的目的是展示GPU的计算潜力，以每秒数十亿次浮点运算（Gflop/s）为单位。人们可能会问：给定一个设备能够提供如此出色的浮点性能，是否有可能将其用于除了图形以外的其他用途？

> 注意，“单精度”指的是 32 位的浮点数表示（有时称为 FP32），而“双精度”指的是 64 位表示（FP64）。单精度数字通常可以比更长的双精度处理得快两倍。

# Heterogeneous Applications（异构应用程序）

It turns out that almost any application that relies on huge amounts of floating-point operations and simple data access patterns can gain a significant speedup using GPUs. This is sometimes referred to as GPGPU, or General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units.

结果表明，几乎所有依赖大量浮点运算和简单数据访问模式的应用程序都可以利用GPU获得显著的加速。这有时被称为GPGPU，或者在图形处理单元上进行通用计算。

Historically, NVIDIA CUDA is one of the key enabling technologies for GPGPU. CUDA was among the first APIs to simplify the task of programming numerically intensive routines such as matrix manipulation, Fast Fourier Transforms, and decryption algorithms so they could be accelerated on GPUs. In the time since CUDA was introduced, a number of techniques have arisen to make GPGPU even easier for application programmers, including directive\-based methods such as OpenACC and OpenMP offloading.

历史上，NVIDIA CUDA 是 GPGPU 的关键使能技术之一。CUDA 是最早简化编程数值密集型例程（如矩阵操作、快速傅里叶变换和解密算法）以便在 GPU 上加速的 API 之一。自 CUDA 引入以来，出现了许多技术，使 GPGPU 对应用程序开发人员来说更容易，包括基于指令的方法如 OpenACC 和 OpenMP offloading。

The following are some of the scientific and engineering fields that have successfully used CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate the performance of important applications:

以下是一些科学和工程领域，它们成功地使用 CUDA 和 NVIDIA GPU 加速了重要应用程序的性能：

- **Deep Learning - 深度学习**
- **Computational Fluid Dynamics - 计算流体动力学**
- **Computational Structural Mechanics - 计算结构力学**
- **Seismic Processing - 地震处理**
- **Bioinformatics - 生物信息学**
- **Materials Science - 材料科学**
- **Molecular Dynamics - 分子动力学**
- **Quantum Chemistry - 量子化学**
- **Computational Physics - 计算物理学**

Numerous examples of applications in the above areas can be found in the NVIDIA document [GPU-Accelerated Applications](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-accelerated-applications/).

在 NVIDIA 文档 GPU-Accelerated Applications 中可以找到以上领域的许多应用程序的示例。

Of course, GPUs are hosted on CPU-based systems. Given a heterogeneous computer containing both CPUs and GPUs, it may be a good strategy to offload the massively parallel and numerically intensive tasks to one or more GPUs. Since most HPC applications contain both highly parallel and less-parallel parts, adopting a heterogeneous programming model is frequently the best way to utilize the strengths of both GPUs and CPUs. It allows the application to take advantage of the highly parallel GPU hardware to produce higher overall computational throughput.

当然，GPU 是宿主在基于 CPU 的系统上。鉴于包含 CPU 和 GPU 的异构计算机，将大规模并行和数值密集型任务卸载到一个或多个 GPU 上可能是一个好策略。由于大多数 HPC 应用程序包含高度并行和不太平行的部分，采用异构编程模型通常是利用 GPU 和 CPU 优势的最佳方式。它允许应用程序利用高度并行的 GPU 硬件产生更高的总体计算吞吐量。

In heterogeneous systems, the GPUs can be supplied through standard graphics cards, such as the NVIDIA Quadro, or through high-end accelerator cards, such as the NVIDIA Tesla. The Tesla comes with extra processing power, double-precision capability, special memory, and other features to make it even more favorable for HPC. But NVIDIA devices of both kinds are capable of accelerating a variety of computational tasks, e.g., half-precision arithmetic for machine learning.

在异构系统中，GPU 可以通过标准图形卡供应，如 NVIDIA Quadro，或通过高端加速卡，如 NVIDIA Tesla。Tesla 提供了额外的处理能力，双精度能力，特殊内存和其他功能，使其更适合 HPC。但 NVIDIA 的两种设备类型都能够加速各种计算任务，例如机器学习的半精度算术。

Either way, GPUs may outperform CPU-based processors by quite a lot, assuming the application is able to make full use of the hardware's inherent parallelism. As we will see, in TACC's Frontera system, the raw speed of single-precision computations in one of its CPU-based Intel "Cascade Lake" processors—specifically, an Intel Xeon Platinum 8280—is 4.3 Tflop/s; whereas just one of its GPUs, a Quadro RTX 5000, can potentially reach 11.2 Tflop/s, and a single one of the Tesla V100s in the companion Longhorn system (now decommissioned) might go as high as 15.7 Tflop/s.

不管怎样，GPU 可能会比基于 CPU 的处理器性能高出很多，假设应用程序能够充分利用硬件的固有并行性。正如我们将看到的，在 TACC 的 Frontera 系统中，其基于 CPU 的Intel "Cascade Lake"处理器之一——特别是 Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 —— 的单精度计算原始速度为 4.3 Tflop/s；而其中的一个 GPU，Quadro RTX 5000，可能达到 11.2 Tflop/s，而配套的 Longhorn 系统（现已退役）中的一个 Tesla V100 可能高达 15.7 Tflop/s。

# Threads and Cores Redefined（重新定义线程和核心）

What is the secret to the high performance that can be achieved by a GPU? The answer lies in the graphics pipeline that the GPU is meant to "pump": the sequence of steps required to take a scene of geometrical objects described in 3D coordinates and render them on a 2D display.

GPU 实现高性能的秘诀是什么？答案在于 GPU 所要“传输”的图形流水线：获取以 3D 坐标描述的几何对象场景并将其渲染到 2D 显示屏上所需的一系列步骤。

Two key properties of the graphics pipeline permit its speed to be accelerated. First, a typical scene is composed of many independent objects (e.g., a mesh of tiny triangles approximating a surface). Second, the sequence of steps needed to render each of the objects is basically the same for all of the objects, so that the computational steps may be performed in parallel on all them at once. By their very nature, then, GPUs must be highly capable parallel computing engines.

图形流水线的两个关键特性使其速度得以加快。首先，典型的场景由许多独立的对象组成（例如，近似表面的微小三角形网格）。其次，渲染每个对象所需的步骤顺序对于所有对象基本相同，因此可以同时对所有对象并行执行计算步骤。因此，就其本质而言，GPU 必须是功能强大的并行计算引擎。

But CPUs, too, have evolved to become highly capable parallel processors in their own right—and in this evolution, they have acquired certain similarities to GPUs. Therefore, it is not surprising to find a degree of overlap in the terminology used to describe the parallelism in both kinds of processors. However, one should be careful to understand the distinctions as well, because the precise meanings of terms can differ signficantly between the two types of devices.

但 CPU 也已经发展成为功能强大的并行处理器，并且在这一发展过程中，它们与 GPU 具有某些相似之处。因此，在描述这两种处理器的并行性时使用的术语有一定程度的重叠也就不足为奇了。但是，人们也应该小心理解其中的区别，因为这两种设备之间术语的确切含义可能有很大不同。

For example, with CPUs as well as GPUs, one may speak of **_threads_** that run on different **_cores_**. In both cases, one envisions distinct _streams of instructions_ that are scheduled to run on different _execution units_. Yet the ways in which _threads_ and _cores_ act upon data are quite different in the two cases.

例如，对于 CPU 和 GPU，我们可能会说 **_线程_** 运行在不同 **_核心_** 上。在这两种情况下，我们都会设想不同的 _指令流_，它们被安排在不同的 _执行单元_ 上运行。然而，在这两种情况下， _线程_ 和 _核心_ 对数据的操作方式却截然不同。

It turns out that a single core in a GPU—which we'll call a **_CUDA core_** hereafter, for clarity—is much more like a single vector lane in the vector processing unit of a CPU. Why? Because CUDA cores are essentially working in teams of 32 to execute a [Single Instruction on Multiple Data](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/parallel/hpc/taxonomy-parallel-computers), a type of parallelism known as SIMD. In CPUs, SIMD operations are possible as well, but they are carried out by vector units, based on smaller data groupings (typically 8 or 16 elements).

事实证明，GPU 中的单个核心（为清楚起见，我们以下将其称为 **_CUDA 核心_**）更像是 CPU 矢量处理单元中的单个矢量通道。为什么？因为 CUDA 核心本质上是以 32 个为一组来执行 [多数据上的单条指令](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/parallel/hpc/taxonomy-parallel-computers)，这是一种称为 SIMD 的并行类型。在 CPU 中，也可以进行 SIMD 操作，但它们是由矢量单元基于较小的数据分组（通常为 8 个或 16 个元素）执行的。

The table below attempts to reduce the potential sources of confusion. It lists and defines the terms that apply to the various levels of parallelism in a GPU, and gives their rough equivalents in CPU terminology. (Several new terms are introduced below; they are further explained on succeeding pages.)

下表旨在减少可能引起混淆的地方。它列出并定义了适用于 GPU 中各种并行级别的术语，并给出了它们在 CPU 术语中的粗略对应。（下面介绍了几个新术语；它们将在后续页面中进一步解释。）

# SIMT and Warps（SIMT 和 Warps）

On the preceding page we encountered two new GPU\-related terms, SIMT and warp. Let's explore their meanings and implications more thoroughly.

在上一页中，我们遇到了两个与 GPU 相关的新术语，SIMT 和 warp。让我们更深入地探讨它们的含义和影响。

## SIMT（单指令多线程）

As you might expect, the NVIDIA term "Single Instruction Multiple Threads" (SIMT) is closely related to a better known term, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD). What's the difference? In pure SIMD, a single instruction acts upon _all_ the data in _exactly_ the same way. In SIMT, this restriction is loosened a bit: selected threads can be activated or deactivated, so that instructions and data are processed only on the active threads, while the local data remain unchanged on inactive threads.

正如我们所料，NVIDIA 术语“单指令多线程”(SIMT) 与更广为人知的术语“单指令多数据”(SIMD) 密切相关。两者有什么区别？在纯 SIMD 中，一条指令以完全相同的方式作用于所有数据。在 SIMT 中，此限制略有放松：可以激活或停用选定的线程，以便仅在活动线程上处理指令和数据，而非活动线程上的本地数据保持不变。

As a result, SIMT can accommodate branching, though not very efficiently. Given an _if-else_ construct beginning with _if (condition)_, the threads for which _condition==true_ will be active when running statements in the _if_ clause, and the threads for which _condition==false_ will be active when running statements in the _else_ clause. The results should be correct, but the inactive threads will do no useful work while they are waiting for statements in the active clause to complete. Branching within SIMT is illustrated in the figure below.

因此，SIMT 可以适应分支，尽管效率不高。给定一个以 _if (condition)_ 开头的 _if-else_ 构造，在运行 _if_ 子句中的语句时，_condition==true_ 的线程将处于活动状态，在运行 _else_ 子句中的语句时，_condition==false_ 的线程将处于活动状态。结果应该是正确的，但不活动的线程在等待活动子句中的语句完成时不会做任何有用的工作。下图说明了 SIMT 中的分支。

![Threads in the same warp cannot execute statements in the if-block in parallel with statements in the else-block. The timeline shows that only one group of threads or the other can be active.](img/simtVolta.png)

How an if-else is executed in the Volta implementation of SIMT.

The figure, like several others in this topic, is taken from NVIDIA's [Volta architecture whitepaper](https://images.nvidia.com/content/volta-architecture/pdf/volta-architecture-whitepaper.pdf). It illustrates how an _if-else_ construct can be executed by a recent GPU such as the Tesla V100 (or later).

该图与本主题中的其他几张图一样，取自 NVIDIA 的 [Volta 架构白皮书](https://images.nvidia.com/content/volta-architecture/pdf/volta-architecture-whitepaper.pdf)。它说明了如何通过最新的 GPU（例如 Tesla V100（或更高版本））执行 _if-else_ 构造。

> Info:

> Note that in NVIDIA GPUs prior to Volta, the entire _if_ clause (i.e., both statements A and B) would have to be executed by the relevant threads, then the entire _else_ clause (both statements X and Y) would have to be executed by the remainder of the threads, then all threads would have to synchronize before continuing execution (statement Z). Volta's more flexible SIMT model permits synchronization of shared data at intermediate points (say, after A and X).

> 信息：

> 请注意，在 Volta 之前的 NVIDIA GPU 中，整个 _if_ 子句（即语句 A 和 B）必须由相关线程执行，然后整个 _else_ 子句（语句 X 和 Y）必须由其余线程执行，然后所有线程必须同步才能继续执行（语句 Z）。Volta 更灵活的 SIMT 模型允许在中间点（例如，在 A 和 X 之后）同步共享数据。

It is worth observing that a form of SIMT also exists on CPUs. Many vector instructions in Intel's x86\_64 have masked variants, in which a vector instruction can be turned on/off for selected vector lanes according to the true/false values in an extra vector operand. This extra operand is called a "mask" because it functions like one: it "hides" certain vector lanes. And the masking trick enables branching to be vectorized on CPUs, too, to a limited extent.

值得注意的是，CPU 上也存在一种 SIMT 形式。英特尔 x86\_64 中的许多矢量指令都有掩码变体，其中可以根据额外矢量操作数中的真/假值针对选定的矢量通道打开/关闭矢量指令。这个额外的操作数被称为“掩码”，因为它的功能就像掩码一样：它“隐藏”某些矢量通道。而且掩码技巧也使分支在 CPU 上能够在一定程度上矢量化。

In contrast to how CPU code is written, SIMT parallelism on the GPU does not have to be expressed through "vectorized loops". Instead—at least in CUDA—every GPU thread executes the kernel code as written. This somewhat justifies NVIDIA's "thread" nomenclature.

与 CPU 代码的编写方式不同，GPU 上的 SIMT 并行性不必通过“矢量化循环”来表达。相反，至少在 CUDA 中，每个 GPU 线程都会按编写的方式执行内核代码。这在某种程度上证明了 NVIDIA 的“线程”命名法的合理性。

> Info:

> Note that GPU code can also be written by applying OpenMP or OpenACC directives to loops, in which case it can end up looking very much like vectorized CPU code.

> 信息：

> 请注意，GPU 代码也可以通过将 OpenMP 或 OpenACC 指令应用于循环来编写，在这种情况下，它最终看起来非常像矢量化的 CPU 代码。

## Warps

At runtime, a block of threads is divided into warps for SIMT execution. One full warp consists of a bundle of 32 threads with consecutive thread indexes. The threads in a warp are then processed together by a set of 32 CUDA cores. This is analogous to the way that a vectorized loop on a CPU is chunked into vectors of a fixed size, then processed by a set of vector lanes.

在运行时，线程块被划分为 Warp 以用于 SIMT 执行。一个完整的 Warp 由一组具有连续线程索引的 32 个线程组成。然后，Warp 中的线程由一组 32 个 CUDA 核心一起处理。这类似于将 CPU 上的矢量化循环划分为固定大小的矢量，然后由一组矢量通道进行处理的方式。

The reason for bundling threads into warps of 32 is simply that in NVIDIA's hardware, CUDA cores are divided into fixed groups of 32. Each such group is analogous to a vector processing unit in a CPU. Breaking down a large block of threads into chunks of this size simplifies the SM's task of scheduling the entire thread block on its available resources.

将 32 个线程捆绑由一个 Warp 执行的原因很简单，因为在 NVIDIA 的硬件中，CUDA 核心被分成 32 个固定组。每个这样的组都类似于 CPU 中的矢量处理单元。将一大块线程分解成这种大小的块可以简化 SM 在可用资源上调度整个线程块的任务。

Apparently NVIDIA borrowed the term "warp" from weaving, where it refers to the set of vertical threads through which the weaver's shuttle passes. To quote the [original paper by Lindholm et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4523358) that introduced SIMT, "The term _warp_ originates from weaving, the first parallel-thread technology." (NVIDIA continues to use this quote in their [CUDA C++ Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#simt-architecture).)

显然，NVIDIA 借用了“warp”一词，该词指的是织布机梭子穿过的一组垂直线。引用介绍 SIMT 的 [Lindholm 等人的原始论文](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4523358)，“warp”一词源自编织，这是第一种并行线程技术。”（NVIDIA 继续在其 [CUDA C++ 编程指南](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#simt-architecture) 中使用这句话。）

One could argue that the existence of warps is a hardware detail that isn't directly relevant to application programmers. However, the warp-based execution model has implications for performance that can influence coding choices. For example—as the figure above illustrates—branching can complicate the execution flow of a warp, if two threads in the same warp branch to different instructions. Thus, a programmer might want to avoid branching within warp-sized sets of loop iterations.

有人可能会认为 Warp 的存在是硬件细节，与应用程序程序员没有直接关系。但是，基于 Warp 的执行模型对性能有影响，可能会影响编码选择。例如，如上图所示，如果同一 Warp 中的两个线程分支到不同的指令，分支会使 Warp 的执行流程复杂化。因此，程序员可能希望避免在 Warp 大小的循环迭代集内进行分支。

# Kernels and SMs

We continue our survey of GPU-related terminology by looking at the relationship between kernels, thread blocks, and streaming multiprocessors (SMs).

我们通过研究内核、线程块和流多处理器（SM）之间的关系来继续对 GPU 相关术语的调查。

## Kernels (in software)

A function that is meant to be executed in parallel on an attached GPU is called a _kernel_. In CUDA, a kernel is usually identified by the presence of the `__global__` specifier in front of an otherwise normal-looking C++ function declaration. The designation `__global__` means the kernel may be called from either the host or the device, but it will execute on the device.

要在连接的 GPU 上并行执行的函数称为 _kernel_。在 CUDA 中，内核通常通过在看似正常的 C++ 函数声明前面添加 `__global__` 说明符来标识。`__global__` 表示内核可以从主机或设备调用，但它将在设备上执行。

Instead of being executed only once, a kernel is executed N times in parallel by N different threads on the GPU. Each thread is assigned a unique ID (in effect, an index) that it can use to compute memory addresses and make control decisions.

内核并非只执行一次，而是由 GPU 上的 N 个不同线程并行执行 N 次。每个线程都分配有一个唯一 ID（实际上是一个索引），可用于计算内存地址并做出控制决策。

![Each thread works on a different index (threadID) in an array of inputs to produce an array of outputs](img/kernelThreads.png)

来源：[NVIDIA CUDA 区域](https://www.nvidia.com/content/cudazone/download/Getting_Started_w_CUDA_Training_NVISION08.pdf)

Accordingly, kernel calls must supply special arguments specifying how many threads to use on the GPU. They do this using CUDA's "execution configuration" syntax, which looks like this: `fun<<<1, N>>>(x, y, z)`. Note that the first entry in the configuration (1, in this case) gives the number of _blocks_ of N threads that will be launched.

因此，内核调用必须提供特殊参数，指定在 GPU 上使用多少个线程。它们使用 CUDA 的“执行配置”语法来实现这一点，如下所示：`fun<<<1, N>>>(x, y, z)`。请注意，配置中的第一个条目（在本例中为 1）给出了将启动的 N 个线程的 _blocks_ 数量。

## Streaming multiprocessors (in hardware)

On the GPU, a kernel call is executed by one or more streaming multiprocessors, or SMs. The SMs are the hardware homes of the CUDA cores that execute the threads. The CUDA cores in each SM are always arranged in sets of 32 so that the SM can use them to execute full warps of threads. The exact number of SMs available in a device depends on its NVIDIA processor family (Volta, Turing, etc.), as well as the specific model number of the processor. Thus, the Volta chip in the Tesla V100 has 80 SMs in total, while the more recent Turing chip in the Quadro RTX 5000 has just 48.

在 GPU 上，内核调用由一个或多个流式多处理器 (SM) 执行。SM 是执行线程的 CUDA 核心的硬件之家。每个 SM 中的 CUDA 核心始终以 32 个为一组排列，以便 SM 可以使用它们来执行完整的线程束。设备中可用的 SM 的确切数量取决于其 NVIDIA 处理器系列（Volta、Turing 等）以及处理器的具体型号。因此，Tesla V100 中的 Volta 芯片总共有 80 个 SM，而 Quadro RTX 5000 中较新的 Turing 芯片只有 48 个。

However, the number of SMs that the GPU will actually use to execute a kernel call is limited to the number of thread _blocks_ specified in the call. Taking the call `fun<<<M, N>>>(x, y, z)` as an example, there are at most M blocks that can be assigned to different SMs. A thread block may not be split between different SMs. (If there are more blocks than available SMs, then more than one block may be assigned to the same SM.) By distributing blocks in this manner, the GPU can run independent blocks of threads in parallel on different SMs.

但是，GPU 实际用于执行内核调用的 SM 数量受限于调用中指定的线程块数量。以调用 `fun<<<M, N>>>(x, y, z)` 为例，最多有 M 个块可以分配给不同的 SM。线程块不能在不同的 SM 之间分割。（如果块的数量多于可用的 SM，则可以将多个块分配给同一个 SM。）通过以这种方式分配块，GPU 可以在不同的 SM 上并行运行独立的线程块。

Each SM then divides the N threads in its current block into warps of 32 threads for parallel execution internally. On every cycle, each SM's schedulers are responsible for assigning full warps of threads to run on available sets of 32 CUDA cores. (The Volta architecture has 4 such schedulers per SM.) Any leftover, partial warps in a thread block will still be assigned to run on a set of 32 CUDA cores.

然后，每个 SM 将其当前块中的 N 个线程划分为 32 个线程的 Warp，以便在内部并行执行。在每个周期中，每个 SM 的调度程序负责分配完整的线程 Warp，以在可用的 32 个 CUDA 核心组上运行。（Volta 架构每个 SM 有 4 个这样的调度程序。）线程块中任何剩余的部分 Warp 仍将分配在一组 32 个 CUDA 核心上运行。

The SM includes several levels of memory that can be accessed only by the CUDA cores of that SM: registers, L1 cache, constant caches, and shared memory. The exact properties of the per-SM and global memory available in Volta GPUs will be outlined shortly.

SM 包含多个级别的内存，这些内存只能由该 SM 的 CUDA 核心访问：寄存器、L1 缓存、常量缓存和共享内存。Volta GPU 中可用的每个 SM 和全局内存的确切属性将很快概述。

# Compute Capability（计算能力）

The technical properties of the SMs in a particular NVIDIA GPU are represented collectively by a version number called the _compute capability_ of the device. This serves as a reference to the set of features that is supported by the GPU. It can even be discovered by applications at run time to find out whether certain hardware properties and/or instructions are present on the GPU.

特定 NVIDIA GPU 中 SM 的技术属性由称为设备_计算能力_的版本号统一表示。这可作为 GPU 支持的功能集的参考。应用程序甚至可以在运行时发现它，以查明 GPU 上是否存在某些硬件属性和/或指令。

Devices with the same first number in their compute capability share the same core architecture. For example, if a device's compute capability starts with a 7, it means that the GPU is based on the Volta architecture; 8 means the Ampere architecture; and so on. Minor version numbers correspond to incremental improvements to the base architecture. For instance, Turing is assigned a compute capability of 7.5 because it is an incremental update of the Volta architecture.

计算能力中第一个数字相同的设备共享相同的核心架构。例如，如果设备的计算能力以 7 开头，则表示 GPU 基于 Volta 架构；8 表示 Ampere 架构；依此类推。次要版本号对应于对基础架构的增量改进。例如，Turing 被分配了 7.5 的计算能力，因为它是 Volta 架构的增量更新。
